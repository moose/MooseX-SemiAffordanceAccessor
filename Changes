0.04   2009-07-09

- This module unconditionally deleted the "is" parameter, which meant
  it broke any use of "is => 'bare'". Reported by Jerome Quelin. Fixed
  by Jesse Luehrs. RT #47711.


0.03   2008-08-30

- Renamed to MooseX::SemiAffordanceAccessor because it no longer
  requires the Moose::Policy module. Instead it uses
  Moose::Util::MetaRole.

- Require 5.6.1 in the Build.PL.

- Added missing Moose & Moose::Policy prereqs.
